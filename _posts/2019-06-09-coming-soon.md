title: Motivations for blogging again..

It’s been a while since I last blogged about anything.. personally, I mean for myself, wherein I express my own views, ideas, experience, and anything in between.

I’ve had (and thankfully still do) the opportunity and privilege of being immersed in projects that I love contributing to, from both a personal and professional standpoint.

A lot of my work involves publishing research material for our industry audience. As such, it requires careful planning, construction, validation and acceptance testing prior to release.

While this is all great, often I have ideas or quite simply "things I feel are worth sharing to enable discourse" but aren’t completely formalized and can’t be published from the company’s platform per se - i.e. I have a professional responsibility to ensure that anything I do publish is both accurate and presents a solution otherwise difficult to find elsewhere.

This is one of the motivations behind blogging again.. to create a space where I can freely share my ideas and unformalized material for critique and to enable constructive discourse. 

Should any of these ideas achieve validation and acceptance (and are of course, relevant to the company), then it gives me the opportunity to formalize them for my company’s benefit.

If they don’t, then I want to be the one who takes the heat for their publication, not the company I work for.. 

Apart from the above, blogging again is exciting for several other reasons:

1. I do have a life outside Quant R&D.. believe it or not ;)
2. I compose music in my spare time, am an amateur but passionate cyclist, and would love to be able to share moments from a jam session, a mountain bike ride, etc every once in a while..
3. I’m a passionate supporter of demonstrated talent and initiative over "labels".. it grates me to see several PhD’s publishing their latest papers with little in the way of practical experience in the trenches, something that is reflected in the contents of their publications.
4. I’d hence also like to use this blog to publish my own "non peer-reviewed" research, making you the readers my peers and reviewers.

I also have a treasure trove of code I’ve written but not organized thoroughly enough over the past two decades, that I’d love to structure into open source packages for both the public’s benefit and my own.. so there’s that.

I’m also an algorithmic trader with over 7 years of publicly verifiable track records under my belt that could do with some exposure to more potential investors than they have now.. 

..hence, one of the objectives of this blog will also be to publish enough material about my trading strategy IP for interested investors, without compromising it in the process.

That will be all for now.. stay tuned for more ;)
